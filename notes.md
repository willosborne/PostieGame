Fuck it let's just make a metroidvania

## Items
- Jump strength
- Double jump
- Wall climb
- 

## TODO
- Add puffs of smoke
    - Jump x
    - Land
    - Wall jump x
    - Air jump x
    - Slide down wall
    - Run x
- Portals for level transitions
    - Need to detect if the player is overlapping a portal when they leave the level
    - If so, keep the target and switch to target level
    - Then place player at target portal location 
    - TODO add entry animation (set entry direction)
- Doors
    - bash out edge portals then add this as it's more flexible (cave story *only* uses doors!)

## Ideas
- Heavy sack/backpack of parcels and letters
- Must leave sack in a safe place, traverse the level and find a way to get the sack to the end 
- Movement severely impaired while carrying sack
- Use a rope to hoist the sack up (this only works for vertical levels)
